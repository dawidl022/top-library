# Library

## JavaScript course - The Odin Project

Project for getting started with constructors and prototypes in JavaScript by
creating a very simple book library application.

[Project: Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library)
is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## About the Application

The application allows users to add books to their personal library collection,
mark books as read or not read, and delete books from the collection. The
book data is persisted in the user's local storage.

The application was styled using Bootstrap.
